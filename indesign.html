            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This is the last project of a sequence completed in a digital graphic design course from the School of Interactive Arts and Technology faculty at SFU. The first two projects were group projects to be completed in grayscale, while this last project was individual and in colour. The skills taught in this course are applying design process, visual elements, digital communication, interpretation. The learning objective of this project was to become more familiar with the design process (such as ideation), design principles, while exercising both individual work, teamwork, and constructive criticism to develop better ideas.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>As continued from the first project, we already created many sketches of different spreads and created a grayscaled six-page spread for submission. The second project saw us criticizing our work and presenting these issues, while the final project incorporated colour and further development of our design skills. This allowed us to work more thoughtfully towards our design, taking in many more considerations to ensure that the reader is intrigued yet not overwhelmed by the spreads. The biggest problem I had during this final project was I had learned from those projects and experimented multiple times before settling with my final designs.

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The project turned out to be successful, as many people in my lab section had very good praises for my spreads and understood the stylistic choices behind my design choices. I felt that I was finally able to express myself with my own style peeking out through my design. It met the objectives determined above as I learned many different methods of ideation and began considering readability, whitespace, and the interaction of elements within my works more creatively.
