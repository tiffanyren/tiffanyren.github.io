            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This is the last project of a sequence completed in a digital graphic design course from the School of
                Interactive Arts and Technology faculty at SFU. The first two projects were group projects to be
                completed in grayscale, while this last project was individual and in colour. The skills taught in this
                course are applying design process, visual elements, digital communication, interpretation. The learning
                objective of this project was to become more familiar with the design process (such as ideation), design
                principles, while exercising both individual work, teamwork, and constructive criticism to develop
                better ideas.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>As continued from the first project, we already created many sketches of different spreads and created a
                grayscaled six-page spread for submission. The second project saw us criticizing our work and presenting
                these issues, while the final project incorporated colour and further development of our design skills.
                This allowed us to work more thoughtfully towards our design, taking in many more considerations to
                ensure that the reader is intrigued yet not overwhelmed by the spreads. The biggest problem I had during
                this final project was bringing the creativity out, since the first two projects gave me more
                restrictions for colour and ideas, since it was done in a team setting. However, I was able to take what
                I had learned from those projects and experimented multiple times before settling with my final designs.

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The project turned out to be successful, as many people in my lab section had very good praises for my
                spreads and understood the stylistic choices behind my design choices. I felt that I was finally able to
                express myself with my own style peeking out through my design. It met the objectives determined above
                as I learned many different methods of ideation and began considering readability, whitespace, and the
                interaction of elements within my works more creatively.
