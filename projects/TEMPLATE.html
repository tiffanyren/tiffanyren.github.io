                                        <h3>Beta-ready in 4 months</h3>
                                        <p>Beginning as an AI-partner for user research, the web platform originally
                                            catered towards UX/UI designer and
                                            design researchers. This proof-of-concept version of
                                            the product required a high degree of manual inputs from the user. Much of
                                            the work here was focused on the technical side of things, rather than
                                            focused on the user experience.</p>
                                        <p>As the previous lead designer on this product departed abruptly, I was given
                                            a tight,
                                            4 month timeline to lead the next phase of this product. However, things did
                                            not go as planned--the
                                            previously collated research for this product had little
                                            evidence to support the adoption and future pricing models.
                                            The original product idea had a very small scope of
                                            potential users, and provided very little added value beyond what other
                                            services could provide for free.</p>

                                        <h3>Redirecting our vision</h3>
                                        <p>To address these issues quickly, I lead multiple discovery sessions with the
                                            internal team, clarifying direction, features, and technical scope. We
                                            produced 15+ new user experience flows over two weeks, presenting them on a
                                            near-daily basis to keep conversations flowing. This resulted in a complete
                                            180 of the product, focusing on a new target demographic, reprioritized
                                            features, and a change in scope and timeline.</p>

                                        <p>To tackle this, I introduced navigation bars that cover both high level
                                            navigation (such as home dashboard and settings), as well as lower
                                            level navigation (within the current feature). This allows the
                                            user to have full control and understanding of where they are in the
                                            application, with an easy way to return to previously accessed pages.

                                        <h3>Visualizing linear flows</h3>
                                        <p>Previously, users were unsure which modules needed to be completed in what
                                            order, which lead to confusion when they accessed a module that was still
                                            locked.</p>
                                        <p>To tackle this, we implemented a linear flow with CRUD (create, read, update,
                                            delete) functionality. This is visualized for the user in their project
                                            overview page.
                                            We also introduced additional flexibility by allowing the user to set
                                            project
                                            goals, which would customize their linear process.</p>

                                            identity. While our original design used a sparkle similar to other
                                            products, I wanted to personify the brand and create something more unique
