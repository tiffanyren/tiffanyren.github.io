        <h1>Surrealism.</h1>
        <div class="container_style1">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This is the personal project pursued within the last few years. The first two projects were completed in Photoshop, while this last project was done using a phone application. Throughout this process, I developed my ideating process, expertise in use of visual elements, and interpretation of objects. The learning objective of this project was to become more familiar with design software, photographic principles, while exercising my creativity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container_style2">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>As continued from the first project, I wanted to create a contrasting image. From the first image, there was a clear sense of serenity and peace. For the second image, I wanted an opposite effect: dark and electrifying. Throughout this version, I was able to experiment more with the use of paint brushes and effects rather than the first, which was almost completely grayscaled.

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container_style1">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>As a final step, I wanted to add some animated aspects to the images created. Using Pixaloop, I animated the clouds over the subject's head. Although the process took a long time, I am very pleased with the resulting images. It allowed me to showcase my creativity and my art direction.
